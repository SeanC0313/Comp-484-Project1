                The Setting & Central Conflict
            </h3>
            <p dir="ltr">
                <i>Dark Moon: The Blood Altar</i> takes place in the mysterious town of <b>Riverfield</b>, centering on <b>Decelis Academy</b>, an elite boarding school that secretly houses vampires. Into this tense environment transfers Sooha, a seemingly human girl with extraordinary strength and resilience. Because of her unnatural abilities, she has spent her life hiding her true nature after being wrongly blamed for a childhood tragedy. Hoping for a normal life, she enrolls at Decelis Academy, unaware that fate is drawing her back into the supernatural world she tried to escape.

            <p dir="ltr">
                Soon after arriving, Sooha encounters seven enigmatic boys who are the most popular students at school, <em>but are secretly vampires</em>. Unlike traditional monstrous portrayals, these vampires are emotionally complex and struggle with loneliness, identity, and the burden of their powers. Sooha's presence begins to awaken forgotten memories and destabilize long-standing supernatural balances.

            <h3>
                The Seven Vampires and Their Unique Abilities
            </h3>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Each of the seven vampires has a distinct ability that reflects their personality and backstory.
                <ul>
                    <li>Heli (Heeseung) wields telepathy, allowing him to communicate mind-to-mind and read thoughts. His power makes him perceptive and composed, often acting as the group's quiet leader. He senses early on that Sooha is deeply connected to their forgotten past.</li>
                    <li>Jaan (Jay) possesses immense superhuman strength. Physically formidable and fiercely protective, he often stands at the front line when danger arises. His blunt intensity hides strong loyalty.</li>
                    <li>Jino (Jake) controls fire (pyrokinesis). His flames appear in moments of heightened emotion or combat, symbolizing both destruction and warmth. He is dependable and empathetic, often serving as emotional support within the group.</li>
                    <li>Solon (Sunghoon) is secretly a vampire-werewolf hybrid, possessing traits of both species. This dual nature becomes a major source of tension, as vampires and werewolves are sworn enemies. His hidden identity adds complexity to the broader supernatural conflict.</li>
                    <li>Shion (Sunoo) has mind manipulation (mesmerization) abilities, allowing him to influence or hypnotize others. Despite his bright exterior, his power reflects subtle control and depth.</li>
                    <li>Jakah (Jungwon) is gifted with extraordinary supernatural speed and sharp intelligence. Quick in both body and mind, he often reacts first in dangerous situations.</li>
                    <li>Noa (Ni-ki) manipulates darkness and shadows, able to merge with or summon them. His ability makes him particularly dangerous in combat and adds to his mysterious presence.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>
                Plot
            </h3>
            <p dir="ltr">
                As Sooha grows closer to the boys, fragments of a long-buried history begin resurfacing. It becomes clear that this is not their first meeting. In a distant past, Sooha was tied to them through an ancient tragedy involving a blood altar, a ritual connected to sacrifice, betrayal, and survival. The vampires carry suppressed memories of losing her once before.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Sooha herself is not merely human. Her immunity to vampire influence and her supernatural strength suggest she is something rare, a being connected to vampire origins and possibly the key to breaking an ancient curse. The more she learns, the more she realizes her existence may reignite old wars.
